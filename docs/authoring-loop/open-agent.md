# What is still wrong that an agent can take

The queue an autonomous lane picks from. Everything here is open; nothing here is
done. **A line is deleted the day it closes** — not struck through, not annotated,
deleted — and if what it settled is something a later agent could get wrong, one
sentence about it goes in `settled.md` instead. Git holds the reasoning, and the
commit that closes a line is where the reasoning belongs.

Each line says what is wrong, how it is known, and what would close it. A line
without evidence is a hunch and does not belong here yet.

Everything here is proved headlessly — `npm test`, `npm run probe`,
`npm run oracle`, `tsc --noEmit` — and the shape is already settled, so a lane can
take one to the end without asking. What waits on the owner's play, his reading of
the writing, or a ruling nobody has taken is in `open-human.md`.

**A GUI line is proved the way `CLAUDE.md` says and no further.** The decision goes
in a `.ts` beside the component and is tested there; the wiring is built, `tsc` and
the suite are run, and it is handed to the author in one line. A lane that cannot
find a pure decision under a GUI line says so rather than reaching for a screenshot
loop. Half of what is below is GUI, because it came out of a playtest.

**A line here that turns out to need his judgement does not stay here flagged — it
moves, carrying what you measured.** Guessing the ruling and abandoning the lane
are the two bad answers, and the second is worse, because the measurement dies with
the session. `deliverable-log.md` states how a line crosses, in both directions,
and is the one place that rule is written.

## From the owner's second playtest, 2026-08-25

`.planning/yonatan-playtests/run-2026-08-25t14-51-24-926z-reviewed.md`, sixty turns
through Miki's route recorded through the playtest tool against `56a2dca7`. Every
line quotes what he wrote at the turn it happened. Four were measured against the
live loader while the run was read, and those carry the measurement — the run is the
evidence a line exists, and the measurement is the evidence about its cause.

### What the chat says, and when

So: talking with more than one thread open **offers the paths as a choice**, quest
threads ahead of the rest, each labelled in words rather than with its first spoken
line. The reproduction is a fresh game on this branch — talk, take *"I'd rather find my
own way"*, refuse again, leave by the window, come back — and today it says nothing and
draws a bare list labelled with each thread's opening line. `isThread`
(`src/content/sections/dialogue.ts`) is `when !== undefined || ask !== undefined`, so
every quest-given node is a thread including one the author wrote `always` on, and
fifteen of Miki's sixteen nodes are threads. **Do not take the one-line `isThread` fix
on its own:** it was measured, it makes Miki speak, and it strands the whole
`apologised` route, because `snubbed.miki.0` becomes an `otherwise` node and
`adrift.miki.0` is `sticky` on a flag that never goes false. `apology-route-full`
apologises before ever leaving the house, so the suite would not catch it — a proof
that walks out of the house and back is part of closing this.

### The fight

**A fight can be armed on a foe that is not standing there.** `armFightAction`
(`src/runtime/runtime.ts`) never checks its target still stands in the room, so a line can
arm against an empty one: it burns an attempt-unit of time and fells nothing. Found by the
lane that made fights chain — Miki's route had two trailing `Fight` lines doing exactly
that, each spending 2400ms and 40 milli-health of regeneration against a cleared cellar, and
cutting them landed the route on its recorded sheet **completely unchanged**, which is what
proved they were no-ops. Pre-existing and unclaimed. *Closes when:* arming a fight on
something that is not there is refused in the player's own words, the way an unmet
`requires:` now is.
