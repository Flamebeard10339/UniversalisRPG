# crafting-modal

Written 2026-08-12, after the author tried to play `items-mods-and-crafting` through the REPL and
could not. That branch made growing an item reachable and correct; it did not make it legible.
Every other play input in this game is a numbered choice, and growth alone requires typing
`allocate: 1 at 0,0 position 1` from memory — three concepts (which copy, which hexagon, which node)
held at once, none of them visible until you already know them. This branch is the surface, and
nothing else: it adds no rule, no refusal and no arithmetic, because those all exist and are tested.

## Deliverable

Carrying, growing and wearing an item are reached the way everything else in this game is reached.
`/inv` opens a modal over what the player carries; an item there offers only the verbs that apply to
it; opening one's plane replaces that screen with a plane screen that holds which copy and which
hexagon are in hand, so a command names only what is left; closing it returns to the inventory with
that item's stats summarised. The directive grammar underneath is untouched and stays total.

Proof:

- [c1] `/inv` opens a modal rather than printing a block. It lists stacks by title and count and each
  grown copy under its own name, and each entry offers only verbs that apply to it — a plane screen
  for an item that can carry one, equip for an item with a slot, drop for anything.
- [c2] The screens are `ModalFrame` members of the closed union in `src/runtime/modals.ts`, opened,
  answered and closed by the machinery `first-class-modals` already ships. Adding one is an engine
  change by that branch's own design; nothing here makes a modal authorable in content.
- [c3] Opening an item's plane replaces the inventory frame rather than stacking a second one, and
  closing it returns to an inventory frame with that item still selected — `submit` returning another
  `ModalFrame` is the substrate's own mechanism for this and no second one is built.
- [c4] **The modal prefills; it never narrows.** Every growth directive stays spellable in full from
  anywhere the directive surface is reachable, and the modal-shortened form is the same directive
  with its leading arguments defaulted from the frame — one parser, one directive kind, not two. A
  frame that one day holds more than one hexagon, or more than one item, or a whole tree at once,
  must not require a grammar change to say so. This is the clause to break first when the
  implementation gets inconvenient, so it is the one to test hardest.
- [c5] Moving between hexagons is answering an option: the frame's focused hexagon changes and no
  game state does. Navigating is not a move, costs nothing, and is not recorded.
- [c6] Slotting from the plane screen names a jewel the player carries and a slot in the focused
  hexagon; allocating names a position or a slot in it. Both route to the runtime functions
  `items-mods-and-crafting` already ships and add no rule of their own.
- [c7] A refusal reaches the player where they are: the screen states it and stays open, and the
  refused verb costs nothing. A refusal that closes the screen, or that is only discoverable in the
  log beneath it, does not satisfy this.
- [c8] An item's contribution is summarised per stat by one pure function below the surface and
  published, so every screen states the same numbers rather than folding them itself. Two surfaces
  that each summarise are two surfaces that will disagree, and the repository's rule is to enforce
  where a value is assembled.
- [c9] **No modal id is a literal in `src/ui`, and a screen the driver has never heard of renders
  and is answerable.** This is `gui-rebuild`'s clause 4, already delivered, and this branch is the
  first real test of it — a plane is not a list of options, so the naive rendering is a special case
  in the driver keyed by the modal's name, which that clause forbids. The mechanism is c10's.
- [c10] What a plane screen shows beyond its options is published as ordinary `PlayStatus` data with
  a focus, not as a payload only one screen understands: the driver renders the focused plane because
  a focus is published, never because it recognised a screen. `PlayStatus.planes` already exists and
  is what the focus points into.
- [c11] The REPL and the GUI drive one command table and cannot differ in what a player may do, per
  `gui-rebuild`'s standing requirement. One scripted sequence through both reaches byte-identical
  state.
- [c12] Dropping an item removes it from what the player carries. Dropping a grown copy is the
  destructive case and is refused or confirmed rather than done silently, because the plane it
  carries cannot be rebuilt and no other verb in this game destroys that much.
- [c13] A `# test` records the whole route — open the inventory, open a plane, navigate, slot,
  allocate, close, equip — and replays green over shipped content, so the surface is a regression
  and not a screenshot.
- [c14] `npm run tasks -- merge-ready` passes before the spec is marked done.

## Goal

Make growing an item something the author can judge by playing it, without teaching them a grammar.

## Decisions

- **The grammar is prefilled, never replaced.** Ruled by the author 2026-08-12. The tempting design
  is a modal-only short form — `allocate 1` as its own thing — and it is wrong twice over: it makes
  two spellings of one action that can drift, and it bakes in the assumption that a screen shows
  exactly one hexagon of exactly one item. A screen that later shows a whole tree would have to break
  its own grammar to address a second hexagon. So the frame supplies defaults for arguments the
  directive already has, and the directive is unchanged. c4 is that decision as a proof clause.
- **The load-bearing uncertainty is c9, and it was found by the survey rather than by building.**
  `gui-rebuild` clause 4 promises that no modal id appears as a literal in `src/ui` and that a modal
  the driver has never heard of still renders. Every modal so far has been a list of options, which
  that promise is easy to keep for. A plane is not a list of options, and the obvious implementation —
  "if the modal is called `crafting`, also draw the plane" — breaks it on the first line. c10 is the
  way out: publish a focus into the `PlayStatus.planes` that `cluster-plane-view` already publishes,
  so the driver renders a focused plane whenever one is focused and never inspects a screen's name.
  If that turns out not to hold, the finding belongs to `gui-rebuild`'s clause and not to this branch,
  and it is worth more than the feature.
- **`craft` is not the word.** `craft:` already means "run a `# recipe`" — a directive kind and a
  choice kind — and spending it a second time is precisely the collision `items-mods-and-crafting`
  spent a paragraph avoiding when it refused to call a cluster effect a "mod". The branch keeps the
  name `crafting-modal` because that is what the author called it and a slug is not a vocabulary; the
  in-game verb that opens a plane is the worker's to choose and must not be `craft`.
- **This branch adds no rule.** Every refusal, every point cost, every adjacency check and the whole
  effect fold exist and are mutation-proved in `items-mods-and-crafting`. A rule appearing in a screen
  is the report that the seam was cut wrong, and the fix is to move it down rather than to test it
  twice.
- **Drop is in scope because the author named it, and it is the one genuinely new capability here.**
  Nothing in this repository destroys an item today. It is a clause rather than a sequel because an
  inventory screen offering two of three verbs and silently omitting the third is worse than one that
  does not offer it at all.
- **It waits for `items-mods-and-crafting` to merge rather than growing it.** That branch is complete
  and green against its own clauses; holding it open until a surface exists would make one diff carry
  two specs and keep the audit target moving, which is the split `gui-rebuild` was already divided
  along for the same reason.

## Out of scope

Showing more than one item's plane at once, or a whole tree across hexagons — c4 exists so that
becomes content of the screen rather than a grammar change, and it is not built here. Any change to
what growing an item costs, refuses or grants. A jewel arriving with an effect already on it,
selection by tag, and the archetype fixtures, all of which belong to `archetype-mods`. Rendering the
plane as geometry rather than as text; a hexagon is addressed by its coordinates on both surfaces
until someone draws one.

## Open questions

- The in-game verb that opens a plane screen, subject only to it not being `craft`.
- Whether dropping a grown copy is refused outright, confirmed, or recoverable — c12 fixes that it is
  not silent and leaves which of the three to the worker and the author.
- Whether the inventory screen replaces `/inv`'s printed block or sits beside it. The clause says it
  opens a modal; whether the old block survives for piped play is a judgement about how `# test`
  fixtures read, and the worker holds the evidence for it.
