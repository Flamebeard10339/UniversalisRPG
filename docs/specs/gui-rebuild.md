# gui-rebuild

## Deliverable

`src/main.tsx` has rendered "Universalis — text-adventure GUI pending" since the legacy GUI was
decommissioned, and `src/ui` does not exist. This branch builds the play surface's second driver: a
React app over the command table and published view that
`in-process-module-api` establishes, with no way to reach the
runtime otherwise. Everything that makes the two drivers the same game is settled by then; what this
branch owes is that the GUI is genuinely one of them and not a second engine wearing a UI.

The screen is a chat log with a bottom action sheet. Home is one scrolling column of narration, the
choices sit in thumb reach beneath it, resources and the clock are pinned above, and the five tabs
are the bottom nav. Modals cover it and are rendered from the name and options the engine publishes,
never from a list of modal names the UI knows. Mobile is the form factor the layout is designed at,
not one it is adapted to afterwards.

Proof:

- [c1] The GUI cannot drift from the REPL, and the proof runs. One scripted sequence of commands
  replayed through the REPL's driver and through the GUI's leaves byte-identical serialized state
  and the same ordered messages. The GUI defines no command of its own and filters none: a command
  added to the shared table is dispatchable from the GUI with no edit under `src/ui`.
- [c2] The GUI cannot alter state. No file under `src/ui` reaches the runtime other than through the
  play surface, and none reads or writes `GameState`. The rule covers `src/main.tsx` as well as
  `src/ui`, which is what the prerequisite's layer-check clause is for — a driver whose entry point
  is exempt from the check has an unchecked door.
- [c3] Every line the player reads comes from the engine. Narration, choice labels, resource titles,
  modal prompts and error text are published values rendered as they are; `src/ui` composes layout
  and never prose. A string the player sees that no engine value produced is a second content
  source, and there is not one.
- [c4] A modal is rendered from its published name and options alone. No modal id appears as a
  literal anywhere in `src/ui`, a modal the UI has never heard of renders and is answerable, and a
  modal's closing path cannot be lost: answering it dismisses it and reveals whatever is beneath.
- [c5] Time runs, and it runs through the shared clock. A spannable action begun in the GUI advances
  simulated time from real elapsed time, shows its progress and can be cancelled; the same action
  begun through the REPL's `--live` reaches the same state over the same elapsed span. Nothing under
  `src/ui` schedules `resolve` or `wait` on a clock of its own.
- [c6] The layout is designed at a phone, and the claim is measured rather than asserted. At
  375×812 nothing in the tutorial route scrolls the page horizontally, every interactive control's
  touch target is at least 44 CSS pixels on its shorter side, the controls used every turn — the
  action sheet and the tab bar — sit in the bottom third, and no affordance requires hover, a
  right-click or a keyboard.
- [c7] The five tabs are one nav and each is one tap away. Home is the narrative log and the action
  sheet. Map renders the locations the player has discovered and how they connect, and acknowledges
  a newly discovered one. Character renders the published inventory, equipment, skills and stats.
  Settings and Edit are frames with no body — `gui-dev-mode-toggle-banner-and-editing-gate`,
  `mod-portal-gui`, `gui-locale-editor-missing-toggle-and-language-dropdown` and `edit-mode-memory`
  own their contents, and this branch owes them somewhere to land, not the landing.
- [c8] The web build carries its content. The shipped DSL reaches the browser through the build, so
  the itch.io bundle and the APK both start a session with no filesystem and no network.
  `public/content/` is not reintroduced: an audit deleted it once (UI-M2) and it is the obvious
  wrong turn back.
- [c9] The agent harness returns, batched, and only in development. A dev-only `window.__test`
  exposes actions registered by the components that own them plus a structured state read, so a
  driving agent calls a name and reads a result instead of scanning rendered text, and a batch of
  commands is one round trip returning one result per step. A production build contains no trace of
  it.
- [c10] Floating text has a channel and the channel is general. A moment the engine publishes can be
  rendered as transient text over the play surface without the component rendering it knowing which
  moment it was. The XP instance is deliberately not wired here — the event does not exist until
  `skill-levels-xp-events` — and `floating-text-for-xp-events` owns wiring it.

## Goal

The game becomes playable by a person on a phone, as a driver of the same surface the REPL drives.

## Decisions

- **Chat log with a bottom action sheet, tabs as the nav.** Settled by the author 2026-08-07. A
  phone is held in one hand, so the controls used every turn live in thumb reach and the narration
  scrolls above them; the tab bar is the only other chrome. The alternative considered was five peer
  full-screen panels — the legacy GUI's shape — which puts the play surface behind a tab and reads
  as a desktop app scaled down.
- **The GUI is a driver, not a second engine, and the drift proof is executable.** The author's
  requirement is that the two play methods cannot drift in capability or function and that the GUI
  cannot alter state directly. The structural half is the prerequisite's — one command table,
  derived help, no reachable `GameState`. The behavioural half is c1 and lives here, because this is
  the first moment two drivers exist to compare. c1 drives the GUI's session container rather than
  React, so the comparison is of two drivers and not of a renderer.
- **Settings and Edit ship empty on purpose.** Four tracked records own their bodies. Building them
  here would absorb four records into a branch that already owes a whole directory, and each of them
  is blocked on something this branch does not deliver — a dev slot, a mod-set decision, a locale
  system, an editor. An empty frame is the seam they were split off to wait for.
- **No persistence.** The session starts fresh on every load, exactly as `play-cli` does.
  `auto-save-export-and-load` and `single-dev-mode` own storage and reset between them; a GUI that
  quietly wrote to `localStorage` would be a second answer to a question they are being planned to
  settle, and CLAUDE.md already records that there is no browser storage to clear.
  `the-browser-save-store-adapter` is where the two meet: it requires this branch and
  `auto-save-export-and-load`, and it is the only record that may put a slot in `localStorage`.
- **Content is bundled at build time.** The browser has no filesystem and the app must start with no
  network, so the shipped DSL is imported by the build rather than fetched. Recorded because
  `public/content/` was deleted by an audit and re-adding it is the reflex.
- **Floating text leaves CLAUDE.md and becomes a record.** The author ruled 2026-08-07 that the line
  "all skill-XP-granting moments must produce floating text" comes out of repository context and
  becomes `floating-text-for-xp-events`, requiring this branch and `skill-levels-xp-events`. That
  spec's Decision naming `gui-rebuild` as the renderer is re-pointed at the new record. A constraint
  exactly one task can act on is a task, not context every session pays to load.
- **The release gate is not this branch's.** `build-deployment-2026-07-28-h2` says the pipeline has
  no gate against publishing a non-functional placeholder. This branch removes the placeholder; it
  does not build the gate, which is a Build & deployment concern and stays open. Removing the
  symptom is not closing the finding.
- **The existing palette is the starting point, not a rewrite.** `user-interface-2026-07-30-l1`
  declined the unused custom properties in `src/index.css` as "plausibly a deliberate palette seed
  for the rebuild"; this is the branch that either uses them or deletes them, and either is an
  answer. The Tailwind content glob narrows to the layer that actually carries classes, which
  retires the low finding that it sweeps three layers below this one.

## Open questions

- Whether the GUI surfaces a command console in this branch or only the generated controls. The
  table is reachable either way. A console is what `single-dev-mode` will gate and what
  `quest-journal` will add `/quests` to, so building it before either exists may be premature —
  left to the worker with the frame in front of it.
- How the map draws. A graph of discovered locations is a layout problem with no settled answer
  here, and a list grouped by connection satisfies c7. `reactflow` was removed as an unimported
  dependency (UI-M3) and is not to be reintroduced without a reason written down.
- Whether the tutorial route is playable end to end when this merges. `starting-zone` is separately
  blocked, so `first-playtest` may still wait; that is a content question, not this branch's.
